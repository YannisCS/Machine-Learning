# Machine-Learning
ML is a field of computer science concerned with programs that learn, it is a subfield of AI. ML is the building of computer algorithms that are trained from examples. That algorithm learns from showing it many examples of past behaviour. After the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict future behaviour.

AI overlaps with ML, it is also an area of computer science concerned with developing programs that are intelligent, or can do intelligent things, which invovles learning, e.g.machine learning.  

Statistics overlaps with the corner of ML interested in learning patterns in data.
