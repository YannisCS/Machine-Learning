# Machine-Learning
ML is a field of computer science concerned with programs that learn, it is a subfield of AI. ML is the building of computer algorithms that are trained from examples. That algorithm learns from showing it many examples of past behaviour. After the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict future behaviour.

AI overlaps with ML, it is also an area of computer science concerned with developing programs that are intelligent, or can do intelligent things, which invovles learning, e.g.machine learning.  

Statistics overlaps with the corner of ML interested in learning patterns in data.    

## Model
A model is a represnetation of something, could be [first principle equations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341980871_The_First_Principles_for_Artificial_Intelligence), simulations and rule systems, statistical model.

## Fraud Detection
Fraud is a wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain, e.g.credit card transaction fraud, healthcare claims fraud and abuse, telecommunication fraud, and etc. Fraud detection is a kind of anomaly detection that finds unusual events, to indentify each record whether is a fraud.  

This project is a supervised binary classify problem.
